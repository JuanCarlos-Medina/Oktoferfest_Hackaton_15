#The Idea

VoucherInABottle gives the opportunity to make shopping a new and interesting adventure. 
While visiting different stores, the customer will receive Vouchers with attractive discounts. 
The customer can also pass these vouchers to other people who cross his or her way at any point in time afterwards. 
Proximity is the key in this App. 
The catch is, as costumer you can only have 5 coupons at a time. 
Passing the vouchers gives the opportunity to free voucher slots to receive more offers 

#Implementation

The Repository presents the basic App with Android. As prerequisties Android Studio is needed. For now the P2P API is still in beta phase 
and the response from the preconnetion can be delayed (can take up to 3 min). Improvements from P2PKit should come soon.
